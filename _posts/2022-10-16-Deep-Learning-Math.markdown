# Introduction

This post explains some basic math behind Deep Learning. Starting with data fitting and building up to artificial neural networks.

# Data Fitting

The simplest example is fitting a linear function to data $$ f(x; m, b) = y = mx + b $$

Testing $$ \LaTeX $$ $$ \nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$
