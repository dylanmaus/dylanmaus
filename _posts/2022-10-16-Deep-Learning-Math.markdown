# Introduction
This article explains the math behind Deep Learning. Starting with basic data fitting and building up to artificial neural networks.

# Data Fitting
The simplest example is fitting a linear function to data. $$ f(x; m, b) = y = mx + b $$

Testing $$ \LaTeX $$ $$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$
